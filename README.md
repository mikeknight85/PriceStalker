## You Choose the Price. Always.

**Unlike other price trackers that silently pick a price and hope it's right**, PriceStalker uses a multi-strategy extraction system with a unique **Price Voting Modal** that puts you in control.

### How It Works

When you add a product, PriceStalker runs **four independent extraction methods** in parallel:

| Method | How It Works | Reliability |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **JSON-LD** | Reads schema.org structured data embedded by the retailer | Highest |
| **Site-Specific** | Custom-tuned scrapers for major retailers (Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, etc.) | High |
| **Generic CSS** | Intelligent CSS selectors that find price patterns | Medium |
| **AI Analysis** | Claude/GPT/Ollama analyzes the page context | High |

Each method "votes" on what it thinks the price is. If they agree, you're good to go. If they disagree, **you see all the candidates and make the final call**.

### The Price Selection Modal

<p align="center">
  <em>Multiple prices found? No problem. You decide which one is correct.</em>
</p>

The modal shows you:
- **Every price candidate** found by each extraction method
- **Confidence scores** so you know which ones are most reliable
- **Context** explaining where each price was found (e.g., "Structured Data", "Site Scraper", "AI Extraction")
- **The product image and name** so you can verify you're tracking the right item

This means:
- No more accidentally tracking a "Save $200" discount amount instead of the actual price
- No more confusion between monthly payment plans ($49/mo) and the real price ($1,999)
- No more tracking bundle prices when you wanted the single item
- **You always know exactly what price you're tracking**

This feature doesn't exist in Keepa, CamelCamelCamel, Honey, or any other price tracker we've seen. They guess. You choose.

## Built by AI. Built Right.

This entire application was developed collaboratively with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant) using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). Every feature, from database migrations to responsive UI components, was crafted through iterative conversation and careful code generation.

**This is not "AI slop."** This is a fully functional, production-ready application with:
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clean, maintainable TypeScript codebase
- Real security practices (JWT auth, bcrypt hashing, input validation)
- Thoughtful UX with toast notifications, loading states, and responsive design
- Comprehensive API with consistent patterns

Built with Claude Opus 4.5.

## Strongly Recommended: Enable AI Features

While PriceStalker includes multiple scraping strategies (JSON-LD, meta tags, CSS selectors, pattern matching, and headless browser), **we highly recommend enabling AI-powered features** for the best results.

Modern e-commerce sites use increasingly complex layouts, dynamic pricing, and anti-scraping measures. AI can understand page context and reliably extract prices even from difficult sites.

### AI Extraction (Fallback)
When standard scraping fails to find a price, AI extraction kicks in as a fallback.

### AI Verification (Recommended)
Verifies every scraped price to ensure accuracy. This catches issues like accidentally scraping a "savings" amount ($189.99 off) instead of the actual product price ($675.59).

### AI Arbitration
When multiple extraction methods disagree, AI can analyze all candidates and recommend the correct one - which you can then confirm or override in the Price Selection Modal.

**To enable:**
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) (Claude), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com), or install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) locally (free)
2. Go to Settings > AI Extraction
3. Enable **AI Extraction** (fallback) and/or **AI Verification** (recommended)
4. Select your provider and enter your API key (or Ollama URL)

The cost is minimal (fractions of a cent per API call with Claude Haiku/GPT-4o-mini). Ollama is completely free but requires local compute.

#### Recommended Models

Based on testing, these models work best with PriceStalker:

| Provider | Model | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | ⭐ Best overall - fast, accurate, cheap (~$0.001/check) |
| **Ollama** | Qwen3 (any size) | ⭐ Best free option - run `ollama pull qwen3` |
| OpenAI | GPT-4.1 Nano | Good alternative to Haiku |

**Note for Ollama users**: Qwen3 works well for price extraction and verification. Other models (llama3, mistral, deepseek) may struggle with structured JSON output or have thinking mode issues.

The AI automatically activates when standard scraping fails to extract a price, providing a reliable fallback.

## Rate Limiting & Best Practices

To avoid getting blocked by retailers:

- **Staggered checking** - Products are checked at randomized intervals with ±5 minute jitter
- **Request delays** - 2-5 second random delay between checking different products
- **Reasonable intervals** - Default 1 hour; use longer intervals if tracking many products
- **Browser headers** - Requests use standard browser User-Agent strings
- **5-minute warning** - UI warns when selecting aggressive check intervals
