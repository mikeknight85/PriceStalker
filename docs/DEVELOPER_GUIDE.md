# PriceStalker Developer Guide

This document describes the codebase architecture, development workspace setup, unit testing, and debugging workflows when modifying the PriceStalker application.

## 1. Project Directory Structure

PriceStalker V2 utilizes a monorepo workspace managed with pnpm, separating components into distinct backend, frontend, and utility sub-projects.

```
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── app/            # Application bootstrappers (migrations, cron loops)
│   │   ├── migrations/     # Idempotent DB schema changes
│   │   ├── routes/         # Express endpoint controllers
│   │   ├── services/       
│   │   │   ├── domain/     # Core DDD layers (Aggregate services & repositories)
│   │   │   └── scraper/    # Scraper transport, extraction cascade, & AI logic
│   │   └── utils/          # Universal helpers (price parser, cache invalidator)
│   └── tests/
│       ├── fixtures/       # Mock HTML files for extraction validation
│       └── unit/           # Backend Vitest suite
├── frontend/

│   │   ├── components/     # Globally shared UI components (Icons, Spinners)
│   │   ├── features/       # Feature-sliced aggregates (admin, products, auth)
│   │   │   └── <feature>/  # Each feature folder bundles its pages, hooks, & services
│   │   └── utils/          # Null-safe locale and date formatters
├── remotescraper/          # Docker build files for the remote stealth Chromium container
├── deploy/                 # Docker Swarm configuration stack templates
├── Makefile                # Unified project runner commands (make up, make verify)
├── .env.example            # Baseline environment configurations
└── docker-compose.yml      # Multi-container local orchestration
```

## 2. Development Setup & Workflows

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js**: Version 24.x (at least 24.18)
* **pnpm**: Version 11.x (at least 11.4)
* **Docker**: With Compose v2 plugin
* **Build tool**: `make` (POSIX shell required)
* *Volta is recommended to automatically lock Node and pnpm to verified development versions.*

### Running via Local Docker Stack
The Makefile compiles the code into local container images and spins up PostgreSQL, the backend API, and the React frontend.

```bash
# Clone and setup node modules
git clone https://github.com/mikeknight85/PriceStalker.git
cd PriceStalker
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
make check-tools                 # verify system prerequisites

# Copy default configurations and run the stack
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set non-placeholder POSTGRES_PASSWORD and JWT_SECRET
make up
```
The web UI is accessible at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Container Helper Commands
Use these commands to manage your local container stack:
* **`make status`**: View container status and port mappings.
* **`make logs`**: Stream all container logs.
* **`make logs-backend`**: Stream logs for the backend container only.
* **`make up-remotescraper`**: Start the stack including the optional remote Chromium scraper.
* **`make down`**: Stop and remove active containers (preserves database volumes).

### Building with Custom Registries
For organization repositories, forks, or private registry deployments, configure custom registry targets:
```bash
make IMAGE_REGISTRY=ghcr.io IMAGE_NAMESPACE=your-username up
```

### Manual Hot-Reload Workflow
Use this flow if you have a local PostgreSQL instance running natively on your host machine and want to edit and test without containers.

1. Configure `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` in your environment or in a local `.env` file.
2. Run backend migrations and start the hot-reloading backend server:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter pricestalker-backend run db:migrate:dev
   pnpm --filter pricestalker-backend run dev
   ```
3. In a second terminal window, start the frontend Vite development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter pricestalker-frontend run dev
   ```
The frontend is served at `http://localhost:5173`, proxying `/api` requests to the backend API running at `http://localhost:3001`.

## 3. Unit Testing with Vitest

For testing parsers, CSS selectors, extraction pipelines, and database model helper updates without external web scraping dependencies, use **Vitest**.

```bash
# Run all backend unit tests in the suite
pnpm --filter pricestalker-backend test

# Run a specific unit test file
pnpm --filter pricestalker-backend exec vitest run tests/unit/price-extraction.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode for active iteration
pnpm --filter pricestalker-backend exec vitest tests/unit/price-extraction.test.ts
```

### Mocking with HTML Fixtures
Do not run live scrapes during unit tests. Instead, capture raw web pages:
1. Save raw page HTML files inside the `backend/tests/fixtures/` directory.
2. Read the local fixture file in your test suite to run parser checks.

---

## 4. Live Scraper Debugging & Tracing

You can trigger live scraper trace runs without committing database changes using the debug endpoint.

* **Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/debug/extract`
* **Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://www.example.com/product",
    "mode": "scraper",
    "config": {
      "use_remote_scraper": false
    },
    "use_ai": true,
    "returnHtml": false
  }
  ```
  * Set `mode` to `"bypass"` to execute a raw Axios HTTP request.
  * Set `mode` to `"scraper"` to run the headless browser scraper.
  * Set `returnHtml: true` to return the complete fetched DOM structure in the response payload.
* **HTML Page Dumps**: Every debug extraction writes a raw HTML file copy to `/app/backend/debug_html/` inside the container. You can inspect this file to verify exactly what DOM structure the parser evaluated.

---

## 5. Development Code Rules

These rules protect deliberate architecture designs. Breaking them will fail local validations and CI workflows:

* **No Emojis**: Emojis are strictly banned from UI JSX and backend files to prevent rendering layout and theme inconsistencies. Enforced via `pnpm run lint`. Use `<Icon name="..." />` instead.
* **Null-Safe Formatters**: Never call browser `Intl` or `toLocale*` formatters directly with raw user locale values, as `users.locale` can be `null` and will crash rendering. Use the wrapper formatters inside `frontend/src/utils/format.ts` (`formatPrice`, `formatDate`).
* **Error Boundaries**: Every page-level layout and tab section must be wrapped in a `<ErrorBoundary>` component.
* **Idempotent Migrations**: Database migrations under `backend/src/migrations/` must be idempotent. Do not hand-edit shipped migrations; create a new numbered migration instead.
* **No Backend Bundling**: The backend compiles with `tsc` to maintain individual output files under `dist/migrations/` so the bootstrapper can glob them dynamically. Do not bundle backend code.
* **Domain Service Architecture**: SQL query layers must stay within repositories (`backend/src/services/domain/<aggregate>/repositories/`), not in Express routes or service files.
* **Pin Dependencies**: `axios` is pinned to exactly `1.14.0` in all workspaces and must not be bumped.
