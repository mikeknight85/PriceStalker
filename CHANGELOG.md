# Changelog

All notable changes to PriceStalker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-20

First PriceStalker release — a friendly fork of
[clucraft/PriceGhost](https://github.com/clucraft/PriceGhost) (upstream last
released 1.0.6 on 2026-01-26, now inactive). Rebranded, picks up pending
upstream PRs, adds new AI providers, improves multi-currency handling, and
tightens default security.

### Added

- **OpenRouter AI provider** — aggregator access to hundreds of models (free
  tier included) via one API key. Freeform model ID, defaults to
  `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`. Full support for extraction,
  verification, stock status, and arbitration. Closes upstream #23.
- **Groq AI provider** — merged from upstream [PR #27](https://github.com/clucraft/PriceGhost/pull/27)
  by @f-liva. Supports Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 8B Instant, Mixtral 8x7B,
  Gemma 2 9B. Closes upstream #26.
- **Migration path from clucraft/PriceGhost** — env-overridable
  `docker-compose.yml` (`POSTGRES_DB`, `DATABASE_URL`, `POSTGRES_VOLUME_NAME`,
  `FRONTEND_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`). Existing users can
  attach to their `priceghost` database and volume without data movement.
  See `.env.example` for the override block.
- **LICENSE file** (MIT) with attribution to the original author (clucraft)
  and the fork (Michael Kessler). Upstream declared MIT in README only.

### Changed

- **Rebranded** from PriceGhost to PriceStalker across UI, docker
  identifiers, package names, and assets.
- **Base images** bumped from Node 20 to Node 22 LTS (fewer CVEs in base
  layers, addresses part of upstream #31). Postgres stays on 16 to avoid
  forcing `pg_upgrade` on existing volumes.
- **Multi-currency parser** (`backend/src/utils/priceParser.ts`):
  - Fixes the bug reported in upstream #24 where Brazilian Real format
    `R$2.720,00` was parsed as `$2.72`.
  - Added BRL (R$), PLN (zł), KRW (₩), RUB (₽), SEK, NOK, DKK, CNY
    recognition.
  - Swiss apostrophe thousands separator (`CHF 1'234.56`) is now handled.
  - Number-format detection is currency-aware: `2.720` is 2720 for
    comma-decimal currencies (EUR/BRL/PLN/…), 2.72 for others.
- **Frontend price formatting** consolidated into
  `frontend/src/utils/formatPrice.ts`. Replaced six duplicate implementations
  across ProductCard, PriceChart, PriceSelectionModal, ProductDetail,
  NotificationBell (which previously fell back to `$` for CHF), and
  NotificationHistory.

### Fixed

- **Product-name truncation** for rows where the scraper returns titles
  longer than 255 characters. Prevents Postgres `VARCHAR(255)` overflow on
  insert. Merged from upstream [PR #18](https://github.com/clucraft/PriceGhost/pull/18)
  by @ericdaugherty, closes upstream #17.

### Security

- **Removed default host port mappings** for postgres (5432) and backend
  (3001). Nginx in the frontend container proxies `/api` internally via
  docker networking, so there's no reason to expose these to the host.
  Closes upstream #20.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-26

### Added

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-01-25

### Added

  - OpenAI: GPT-4.1 Nano, Mini, and Full
  - Ollama: Any locally installed model

  - Test connection before saving to verify server URL and app token
  - Full notification support for price drops, target prices, and stock changes
- **AI Stock Status Verification** - Separate AI call to verify stock status for variant products
  - When tracking a specific variant price, AI now verifies if that exact variant is in stock
  - Fixes false "in stock" status when other variants are available but tracked variant is not
- **Pause/Resume Checking** - Temporarily pause price checking on individual products or in bulk
  - Pause and Resume actions in the bulk Actions menu
  - Filter dropdown to show All / Active / Paused products
  - Paused products are greyed out with pause icon indicator

### Fixed

- **Ollama Thinking Mode** - Fixed Qwen3 and DeepSeek models outputting `<think>` tags instead of JSON
  - Added `/nothink` message before prompts to disable thinking mode
  - Added `num_ctx: 16384` for proper context window (was truncating HTML at 4K)
  - Added fallback to strip `<think>` tags from responses
- **AI Stock Status "Unknown"** - AI now correctly returns "out_of_stock" for pre-order/coming soon products
  - Previously returned "unknown" even when reasoning stated product was unavailable
  - Prompt now explicitly requires "out_of_stock" when product cannot be purchased

### Changed

- **Recommended AI Models** - Based on testing:
  - **Cloud**: Claude Haiku 4.5 (best accuracy for the cost)
  - **Local/Free**: Qwen3 (any size, with thinking mode disabled)

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Multi-Strategy Price Voting System** - More robust price extraction using multiple methods
  - Runs all extraction methods (JSON-LD, site-specific, generic CSS, AI) in parallel
  - Uses consensus voting to select the correct price when methods agree
  - AI arbitration when extraction methods disagree
  - User price selection dialog when price is ambiguous (multiple prices found)
  - Remembers the winning extraction method for future checks of the same product
- **Price Selection Modal** - When multiple prices are found for a product, users can now select the correct one
  - Shows all price candidates with confidence levels
  - Displays extraction method and context for each candidate
  - Sorted by confidence (highest first)

### Changed

- **Improved scheduler** - Now uses preferred extraction method when available for faster, more accurate re-checks

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-01-24

### Added

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed

- **Stock status false positives** - Fixed overly aggressive pre-order detection that incorrectly marked in-stock items as out of stock. Pages with "in stock", "add to cart", or "add to basket" text now correctly prioritize these indicators
- **Magento 2 stock detection** - Added proper stock status detection for Magento 2 sites, checking for stock classes and add-to-cart buttons

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Puppeteer fallback for JavaScript-rendered prices** - Automatically uses headless browser when no price found in static HTML, fixing extraction for Magento, React, Vue, and other JS-heavy sites
- **Pre-order/coming soon detection** - Products with future release dates, pre-order buttons, or "notify me" messaging are now correctly marked as out of stock
- **AI availability verification** - AI now checks if products are actually purchasable, not just if the price is correct
- **Official PriceStalker branding** - Custom ghost icon in navbar and login page
- **Ghostly text effect** - "Ghost" text in navbar has ethereal fade effect

### Fixed

- **Fresh install registration error** - Backend now creates all required database tables on startup, fixing 500 errors on fresh Docker installs without init.sql
- **Stock status for unreleased products** - Products showing "Coming Soon", "Available [future date]", or "Pre-order" are now correctly detected as out of stock

### Changed

- **CI/CD optimization** - Docker images only rebuild when relevant code changes (backend/** or frontend/**), not for README or documentation updates
